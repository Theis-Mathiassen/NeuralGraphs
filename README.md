## Overview

This project is made alongside a semester project report for AAU, focusing on graph convolutional networks. 
It generates a GNN model for the MUTAG dataset, while providing tools to gather insightful information, and visualizations. 
The hyperparameters can easily be adjusted for experimentation.

## Features

- Can run Bayesian optimization and grid search over a given search space
- Prints out relevant information from dataset
- Visualization of graphs from dataset
- Trains a graph covolutional network
- Measures the accuracy and loss over time
- Plots the AUC - ROC and AUC - PR curve
<!-- - Can compare differnet hyperparameters (Revisit this if unable to complete) -->

## Getting Started

To use this project navigate to the [Main](/Main/main.py) file, which contains the essentials for the project. 
After downloading it, it can be run and adjusted as desired.

### Prerequisites
To run this program it requires python, along with the following libraries.

- PyTorch
- networkX
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- Bayesian_Search
- csv
- seaborn
